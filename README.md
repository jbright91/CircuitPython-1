## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Description goes here

Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
import time
import board
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull
from adafruit_motor import servo
import pwmio

btn = DigitalInOut(board.D4)
btn.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn.pull = Pull.UP

pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.D2, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)
angle = 180


btn2 = DigitalInOut(board.D6)
btn2.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn2.pull = Pull.UP

while True:
    if not btn.value:
        print("BTN is down")
        for angle in range(0, 180, 9):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 9 degrees at a time
            my_servo.angle = angle 
            time.sleep(0.1)
    else:
        print("BTN is up")
        pass
    if not btn2.value:
        print("BTN2 is down")
        for angle in range(180,0, -9):  # 180 degrees - 0, -9 degrees at a time
            my_servo.angle = angle 
            time.sleep(0.1)
    else:
        print("BTN2 is up")
        pass

    time.sleep(0.1) # sleep for debounce

```

And here is how you should give image credit to someone, if you use their work:

### Wiring
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person.
